        "\n",
        "1.   Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. They cannot begin with a number.\n",
        "2.   Python is a case-sensitive language, so age and Age are considered to be different variable names.\n",
        "3.   Avoid using reserved keywords as variable names, such as if, while, for, and class. \n",
        "\n",
        "Are these valid variable names?\n",
        "```\n",
        "age\n",
        "break\n",

        "my_age\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to these rules, there are some guidelines to be used,\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Use descriptive and meaningful names. For example, X0910e is a valid variable name as it doesn't break any of the rules. However, it does not help us understand the value being stored inside the variable.\n",
        "2.   Avoid using names that are too short or too generic, such as x or temp.\n",
        "3.   Be consistent in your naming conventions throughout your code."
